I've updated the app with a mock implementation that:
Creates realistic-looking analysis based on simulated banana characteristics:
Ripeness (ripe/slightly-ripe)
Color (yellow/yellow-brown)
Spots (many/few)
Size (large/medium)
Provides detailed nutrient information that varies based on the detected characteristics:
Potassium (varies with ripeness)
Magnesium (varies with size)
Vitamin C (varies with ripeness)
Vitamin B6 (varies with color)
Fiber (varies with ripeness)
Sugar (varies with ripeness)
Includes a confidence score and analysis timestamp
The UI now shows:
Banana characteristics
Detailed chemical composition with amounts and descriptions
Analysis metadata (confidence and timestamp)
When you're ready to integrate with the real Google Cloud Vision API, you'll just need to:
Replace the analyzeBananaImage function in app/api/analyze/route.ts with real API calls
Add your Google Cloud credentials
The rest of the app will work the same way
Would you like to test it out with this mock implementation?
